			<h3>Is a decentralized web practical?</h3>
						<p>June 20, 2016</p>
			<br>
			<p> As was showcased in many of the top articles on Hacker News today, a 3-day Decentralized Web Summit held in San Francisco last week has many talking about the importance of decentralizing the internet. Many scholars (including Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the WWW) are concerned about the dominance imposed by centralized points of control on the internet (i.e. Facebook, Google), smartphones (Android and iOS), and cloud computing (Amazon). In its article <i>Reweaving the web</i>, the <b>Economist</b> summarizes the concerns with a quote from Harvard scholar Yochai Benkler, &quot;The main fear is that exclusive access to data provided could allow them to predict, shape and nudge the behaviors of hundreds of millions of people.&quot;</p>
			<p> The article discusses how a group of entrepreneurs (with their VC backers) are now looking to re-decentralize the internet. Efforts are assisted by the rise of bitcoin (a crypto-currency), and the blockchain technology that underlies it. As these young technologies continue to evolve, we can expect to see an increase in decentralized applications as well - supported by apparent growing investor interest. </p>
			<p>The article then points out that some of the obstacles faced by the early decentralized applications still have yet to be resolved - namely the complexity of regulating entities that transcend national jurisdictions. (The challenge in the enforcement of copyright law was a significant factor in the demise of former decentralized apps Napster and Kazaa.) It also points out that an application that will net VC expectations on returns will need to be high-growth. </p>
			<p>My thought is to the extent the operation of an application requires specialized knowledge or resources (i.e., a governing, organizing or supporting body is required to make it accessible to its intended users), truly decentralized applications are somewhat impractical. The peer-to-peer type applications most likely to benefit from decentralization (e.g. OpenBazaar, a free marketplace theoretically aimed at competing with Amazon) inherently become more useful as they get larger, thus possessing a self-propelling desire to grow - and thus requiring more centralized governance and/or support. </p>
			<p>Consider a search engine that only indexes part of the web, or a social network that only has a smattering of participants. Unless highly specialized in scope, these would by nature be less useful than their larger counterparts. Perhaps a more realistic goal (particularly where satisfying VC expectations is a requirement for the viability of a company) would be to foster competition and prevent monopolies by creating smaller, &quot;right-sized&quot; applications where content/scope specialization creates incremental value for its users, offsetting any loss in value due to its fewer participants.</p>
