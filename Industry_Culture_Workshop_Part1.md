Question 1: In the example scenarios posited by the researchers, do you feel that either the bosses or subordinates acted out of ill-will? Who do you feel was most at fault? If it's difficult for you to choose, why?

As this article points out, the perceived failings of both the managers and the employees were primarily due to a systemic issue than ill-will, so it's hard for me to accept the word "fault" - I'd prefer to think of it as "accountability". I believe the ultimate accountability is always the responsibility of the manager - as ensuring the effectiveness of subordinates is a primary part of their job description. 

Question 2a: Diversity in Tech: Did any of these numbers surprise you? What do you think contributes to the disparity between these demographics' overall workforce share and share of the tech workforce?

These numbers weren't particularly surprising. To see whites underindexing only as the result of Asians overindexing seems typical of careers in the STEM arena. I would imagine the demographics of students entering programs for preparation for the STEM fields probably look very similar. 

Question 2b: Diversity in Leadership: Are all groups represented in management the way they are in the general tech workforce? Who is under-represented? Over-represented? 

White males are significantly over-represented in technology management, with males being over-represented in general. Women are under-represented. This is not a situation unique to the tech industry. As an career-ambitious woman who took time out of the corporate world to raise children, I can say the issue is a complicated one for me. While the ability to relax the intensity of participation in the workforce for attending to domestic needs shouldn't be the luxury it seems to be, it's hard to argue that those who don't require that flexibility shouldn't be rewarded for their additional commitment. So to some degree, I can understand the disparity. (However, this disparity can mask the straight-up discrimination that is also unfortunately prevalent.)

2b - part 2: Think back to previous jobs you've had or jobs you've aspired to have. Did you see people you identified with as leaders in those professions? Was that important to you? Why or why not?

To the extent I was looking for a leader I identified with that was a mirror image of me demographically - no, I can't say I've found one. I think women can be our own worst enemy when it comes to supporting each other - and I think a lot of this has to do with how girls are socialized in our culture. However, I have had plenty of leaders I have been able to identify with that weren't female, but I do feel like I had to adopt their paradigm in order to make that connection. It would be nice to have leadership that mirrored me both demographically and psychographically, and so the idea is easy to support. I think it would be incredibly challenging to put into practice. 

Question 3: Baker's essay focuses on the personal impact on being one of the few under-represented folks in tech who get through to the other end of the job pipeline. What was something that you found remarkable about her on-the-job experience?

In truth, the thing I found most remarkable is the extent to which she felt it necessary to physically alter her style of appearance to assimilate. I found myself questioning whether or not it was a requirement for her to achieve the results she perceived - or if it was just the effort she was making to connect to the group. It's unfortunate that in her particular situation, we can never be sure. It's even more unfortunate that the only way true diversity will be achieved is when people feel confident in their ability to both 1. be who they authentically are, and 2. be accepted by others. The second part is the responsibility of society. The onus for the first part lies on the individual, and when they make the decision to forgo that, they aren't just losing out for themselves - they are also dropping the ball for building bridges on behalf of similarly-situated individuals. If she'd kept the dreads, but still felt the confidence to proactively embrace her coworkers for acceptance, there would've been a group once agoraphobic of dreadlocks who had built a positive experience with them. I understand it's a tall order - but the agoraphobia in this country, in my mind, has reached a point where it's time to "sink or swim". It's going to take all of us being brave and aware to get us through to a better place. 

I worked with someone at ConAgra named Kunjal. The enunciation of his name was different than this Midwestern American would expect. When I asked how to pronounce it, he thanked me for doing so, and then said he recognized many in the areas in which I had lived had difficulty with it. He depersonalized my ignorance, and assumed the best about what it was - simply ignorance, not necessarily bias. It was a pretty powerful moment. He's on that aforementioned list of leaders who don't mirror me, but I identify with.

3 - part 2: How much should a new employee be expected to change to fit the mold of the industry or company they are entering?

I don't believe a new employee should be expected to change, and I believe the company should systematically entice people to try to authentically get to know people for who they are. Again, a tall order, but important to the future of our country. 

Question 4: Do you think blind-hiring is a sufficient solution to addressing industry biases?
To see if you can you see even a small part of both sides, also describe some of the arguments against your answer.

My first reaction was that I think it's a terrible idea. TERRIBLE. Fostering meaningful diversity means building knowledge, acceptance, and appreciation across cultures. It does NOT mean not acknowledging differences like they are unimportant or don't exist. And what if blind hiring actually resulted in a less diverse workforce? Hopefully highly unlikely, but what if? Yikes.

But then I considered the bias that seems can impact minorities later on in their careers, when judgmental individuals will assume a leader achieved their position because of some sort of affirmative action. It seems like a policy that insured people were at least initially hired purely based on their actual competency would reduce this to some degree. 

I can't help but wonder, understanding a little more about the nature of software development, and how - as in the actuarial example Sumeet gave, there's no objective way to "level up" in this industry - that if a better solution would be the development of an industry-accepted credentialing program. In the absence of commonly-accepted, objective performance criteria, it's somewhat predictable people will tend to hire based on what makes them comfortable, which may unfortunately include biased opinions (particularly subconsciously).

How would you compare blind-hiring to a diversity-first hiring process, like affirmative action?

It does seem more "fair", in an immediate, Darwinistic sense - and probably less likely to cause the (obviously) unintended social backlash that diversity-first hiring programs can cause. But for that to have the intended results, one would need to be assured all had access to the appropriate training and skills development prior to entering the workforce - and that's not something I believe to be true.
